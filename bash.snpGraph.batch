# Requires: R callable from the command line with the igraph package installed

##################### Lines to Avoid ############################
# Leave a single capital X in BADLINES if you don't want to cut anything out
# if you want to cut lines out, separate the lines by spaces and write the exact names all in the same set of quotes
# ex: BADLINES="mut1 mut2 mut3"
BADLINES="X"
